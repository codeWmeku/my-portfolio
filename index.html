              My name is Mikko Dumaguin. I was born in San Fernando, La Union, a peaceful city known for
its serene beaches and welcoming people. My journey in life has been filled with ups and downs,
shaping me into the person I am today. Although I was born in San Fernando, I spent a
significant part of my early childhood growing up in Manila. Life in the bustling capital was
vibrant, with its busy streets and towering buildings. It was an exciting environment, but
everything changed when I was in grade three. At that point, my family decided to move back to
San Fernando, La Union, where I continued my education. This decision marked the beginning
of a new chapter in my life, one that would bring me closer to my roots and provide experiences
that would shape my character.
I was born on the 2nd day of snow—an event symbolic of my uniqueness and the wonder of new
beginnings. As the eldest of four siblings, I grew up with a sense of responsibility. My parents,
whom I affectionately call Mommy and Papa, have been my guiding lights. My mama is Bisaya,
hailing from the southern part of the Philippines, while my papa is Ilocano, deeply rooted in the
northern traditions. Together, they created a home filled with love, resilience, and unwavering
faith.
When I was 12 years old, I embarked on a small venture that marked the beginning of my
journey into entrepreneurship. I started my “visces,” or small business, at an age when most kids
were still solely focused on play. This experience taught me the value of hard work, discipline,
and financial independence. It was a challenging yet rewarding endeavor that ignited a passion
for building and achieving something meaningful.
At the age of 20, I am now a second-year Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT)
student at Lorma Colleges. My dream is to become a successful IT professional, a goal that
drives me to overcome every obstacle that comes my way. I firmly believe in the power of
education and persistence to transform lives, and I am determined to achieve my dreams no
matter the challenges.
One of the most cherished memories of my childhood was playing chess with my great-
grandfather. He was not just a mentor in the game but also a teacher in life. Chess taught me to
think critically, anticipate challenges, and strategize solutions—lessons that have proven
invaluable in my academic and personal life. My great-grandfather also taught me practical
skills, like how to care for our goats and cows. Those days spent under the sun, feeding animals
and learning about the simple joys of rural life, remain etched in my heart as a reminder of the
value of hard work and humility.
Among all my family members, my grandmother held a special place in my heart. She was my
source of comfort, wisdom, and unconditional love. Losing her during my 11th grade was one of
the most challenging experiences I have ever faced. Her passing left a void in my life that was
difficult to fill. I fell into a deep depression and began experiencing anxiety attacks, a period that
tested my faith and resilience. However, during my darkest moments, God showed me the way.
His love and guidance gave me the strength to move forward and find purpose again.

I have grown immensely since then, learning to channel my emotions into my goals and
aspirations. My grandmother’s memory continues to inspire me to be the best version of myself,
as I know she would have wanted nothing less for me.
Today, I remain focused on my studies and my dream of becoming a successful IT professional.
My experiences have taught me that life is not always easy, but with faith, perseverance, and a
clear vision, we can overcome anything. My journey at Lorma Colleges has been a fulfilling one,
filled with opportunities to learn, grow, and prepare for the future.
As a student, I am committed to improving my skills and knowledge in information technology. I
see the field as a gateway to innovation, creativity, and problem-solving. IT is not just a career
path for me; it is a passion that allows me to explore new possibilities and make a difference in
the world.
My life story is a testament to the power of resilience and faith. From my humble beginnings in
San Fernando, La Union, to the challenges I faced along the way, every experience has
contributed to the person I am today. I am grateful for my family, who continues to support me,
and for the lessons life has taught me.
Looking back, I can see how every moment—whether joyful or painful—has played a role in
shaping my character and preparing me for the future. I am proud of how far I have come and
excited for what lies ahead. With determination, hard work, and the grace of God, I know I can
achieve my dreams and make a meaningful impact in the world of information technology.
In my free time, I enjoy reminiscing about the simpler days of my childhood. Whether it’s
playing chess, feeding the animals, or spending time with family, these moments remind me of
where I came from and keep me grounded. They also serve as a reminder that success is not just
about achieving goals but also about appreciating the journey and the people who walk it with
you.
As I continue my studies and work towards my dreams, I carry with me the lessons of my past
and the hope of a brighter future. Life is a journey filled with challenges and triumphs, but I
believe that with faith and perseverance, we can overcome anything. My story is far from over,
and I am excited to see where this path will take me.
